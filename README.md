# php-demo
 This is a php based web application which enables any user to make purchase products online. A user can perform various operations such as change password update password or make payment. I am using xaamp sever to create request response cycles using stateful http sessoins and MySQL to build the database in myphpAdmin. I am looking forward to add some more fatures in my website meanwhile i learn new technologies to make this more interactive and user friendly.

I have uploaded the source code and CSS_JS_product_images ZIP file which contains the required resources for the project.
